# Jester: Bonus World
A mod for Dicey Dungeons that takes Jester's Bonus Round episode and expands upon it and new and interesting ways.
Instead of picking your Finale Card, you now pick your entire deck-
and elements of your run like booster packs and item pools are changed based on your deck choice!
(The decks are just InitialEquipment that give you the deck in a random order
and replace themselves with the finale card- it's the best I can do right now.)
Specifically, picking your deck changes:

-what booster pack reward choices you get at level 2 (and sometimes other levels as well)

-the items affected by your level 2 reward choice

-some if not all of the possible items in the item pools (with the exception of certain decks)

-and for some specific decks, some other rule changes that you should see for yourself!

And that's not all- there's also Bonus World Episode 2: Double Decker! Twice the decks, twice the fun!

**Deck List**

Currently there are eleven decks:

Classic- like Jester episode 1.

Parallel*- like Jester episode 5.

Elemental- focuses heavily on Burn, Freeze and Shock.

MegaQuest*- like Jester episode 1 in MysticSword's mod MegaQuest.

Alt Timeline- like Jester episode 1 in Green's mod Alternate Timeline.

Terrible^- like Jester episode 1, but worse in unique ways that may be blessings in disguise.

Patient- like Jester episode 3 in AngelMoon's mod Cosmic Variations (everything is based around jinxes).

Thief- it's an ordinary day for an ordinary thief. Problem is, you're a jester.

Random- absolute random-card-copying chaos that needs to be seen to be believed.

Spooky*^- inspired by the official Halloween Special mod, focuses on "spooky" statuses like Haunt.

NC- like Jester episode 1 in Wisp's mod NCRMod.

*Has a unique rule change.

^Is composed entirely or almost entirely of brand-new cards made by yours truly!
